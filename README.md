# Pitch Outcome Modeling
Analyzed Statcast data from the 2023 MLB season using `pybaseball` to examine how pitch type, location, and velocity influence exit velocity.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- pybaseball API
- R Shiny (for dashboard visualization)

## Key Findings
- Curveballs low and away produced the lowest average exit velocity.
- Regression model explained 68% of variance in exit velocity.
